## From AST to Semantic Nodes

<!-- TODO: How raw AST nodes are resolved into semantic nodes -->

## Node Types

<!-- TODO: Document semantic node kinds: interface, type alias, import, etc. -->

## Type Resolution

<!-- TODO: How references are resolved, dependency tracking -->

## Annotation Merging

<!-- TODO: How annotations are inherited and merged across type hierarchies -->

## Next Steps

- [Annotation System](/plugin-development/annotation-system) — defining and processing annotations
- [Type System](/plugin-development/type-system) — primitives and type unwinding
