# Type System

::: warning Under Construction
This page is a stub. Content will be added covering the core type system and how plugins extend it.

## Primitive Types

<!-- TODO: Built-in primitives and how they're defined -->

## Semantic Extensions

<!-- TODO: How string.email, number.positive etc. work -->

## Type Unwinding

<!-- TODO: How complex types (unions, intersections, arrays) are resolved -->

## Custom Primitives

<!-- TODO: How plugins define new primitives with annotations and tags -->

## Next Steps

- [Primitives & Type Tags](/plugin-development/primitives-type-tags) — adding new primitives in a language extension
- [Code Generation](/plugin-development/code-generation) — emitting type information
