# Architecture

::: warning Under Construction
This page is a stub. Content will be added covering the overall architecture of `@atscript/core`.
:::

## Overview

<!-- TODO: High-level architecture diagram showing parser → AST → semantic graph → plugins → output -->

## Package Structure

<!-- TODO: Explain the core package structure and how it relates to language extensions -->

## Processing Pipeline

<!-- TODO: Document the full pipeline from .as source to output: parse → resolve → transform → emit -->

## Next Steps

- [Parser & AST](/plugin-development/parser-ast) — how .as files are parsed
- [Plugin System](/plugin-development/plugin-system) — extending the pipeline
