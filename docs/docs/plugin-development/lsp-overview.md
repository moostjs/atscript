## How the Atscript LSP Works

<!-- TODO: Architecture of the VSCode extension's language server -->

## Key Capabilities

<!-- TODO: What an Atscript LSP provides: diagnostics, completions, go-to-definition, hover -->

## Reusing Core Infrastructure

<!-- TODO: How the parser, resolver, and diagnostics are shared between CLI and LSP -->

## Next Steps

- [Completions & Navigation](/plugin-development/completions-navigation) — IntelliSense
