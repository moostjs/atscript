Atscript is a type-focused description language that gives you a single source of truth for types, validation rules, database metadata, and UI hints. Using `.as` files with structured annotations, you can generate TypeScript definitions, runtime validators, database schemas, documentation, and more through its plugin system.

The [Why Atscript](https://atscript.moost.org/packages/typescript/why-atscript) guide describes how consolidating scattered schemas into annotated interfaces keeps contracts consistent across your stack, while the [Quick Start](https://atscript.moost.org/packages/typescript/quick-start) walkthrough shows how to define your first model, configure the compiler, and wire Atscript into your toolchain.
